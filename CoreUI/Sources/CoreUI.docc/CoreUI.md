### CoreUI Module Overview

The **CoreUI module** defines common UI components, extensions, modifiers, and styles that are designed for reuse across multiple screens in the application.

- **Common UI Views**: Pre-built UI elements (e.g., buttons, text fields, etc.) that can be reused throughout the app.
- **Extensions**: Utility extensions for enhancing UI elements or simplifying common UI-related tasks.
- **Modifiers**: Custom modifiers that can be applied to UI components to achieve consistent styling and behavior.
- **Styles**: Shared design patterns and style definitions, ensuring a uniform look and feel across screens.

### Design Philosophy

- The CoreUI module aims to promote consistency and reduce duplication by centralizing common UI elements and styles.
- By using these shared resources, developers can ensure that the appâ€™s UI is cohesive, maintainable, and easy to update.
