### WeatherAPI Module Overview

The **WeatherAPI module** defines the base models and API interfaces that concrete implementations will use. 

- **Base Models**: These serve as the foundational data structures and definitions for weather-related information.
- **API**: This provides the core set of methods that need to be implemented by any concrete class or service interacting with the WeatherAPI.

### Design Philosophy

- The main application, along with all other features and components, should depend on the **WeatherAPI interface** rather than any specific implementation.
- Concrete implementations of the WeatherAPI (e.g., for specific weather services or data sources) should be injected into the application at the app level, ensuring flexibility and decoupling from specific external services.

### Dependency Injection

- By injecting the concrete implementation of the WeatherAPI at runtime, the app remains modular and easier to test. This approach also allows for seamless swapping of weather data providers without affecting the core application logic.
